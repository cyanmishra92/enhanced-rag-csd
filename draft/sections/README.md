# Enhanced RAG-CSD Academic Paper Draft Sections

This directory contains organized sections for the Enhanced RAG-CSD academic paper, with each section containing separate folders for writeups, scripts, figures, and tables.

## Directory Structure

```
draft/sections/
â”œâ”€â”€ motivation/          # Problem motivation and baseline analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ methodology/         # System design and architecture
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation/          # Performance evaluation and benchmarks
â””â”€â”€ implementation/      # Implementation details and case studies
```

Each section contains:
- `writeup/` - Text content and documentation
- `scripts/` - Analysis scripts and data generation
- `figures/` - PDF figures and visualizations
- `tables/` - CSV data files and formatted tables

## Section Details

### Motivation Section Contents

**Key Analysis Areas:**
1. GPU memory swapping and fragmentation issues
2. Data movement costs and bandwidth limitations
3. Computational capability mismatches
4. Modern CSD specifications and ML performance
5. Index rebuilding costs and dynamic updates

**Generated Assets:**
- 21 PDF figures with publication-quality formatting
- 5 comprehensive CSV datasets
- 6 analysis scripts with full documentation
- Master generation script for reproducibility

**Key Findings:**
- 95%+ GPU computational waste on lightweight operations
- 85-95% data movement reduction with CSD approach
- 29% better power efficiency with ARM cores for encoding
- 97% cost reduction for index maintenance operations
- 2.6Ã— throughput improvement eliminating memory swapping

## Academic Paper Integration

The organized structure enables:
- **Modular Development**: Each section can be developed independently
- **Version Control**: Clear separation of content types for better tracking
- **Collaboration**: Multiple authors can work on different sections
- **Reproducibility**: All analysis scripts and data generation are preserved
- **Publication**: Direct integration with LaTeX or other academic writing tools

## Next Steps

1. **Methodology Section**: System design and architecture documentation
2. **Evaluation Section**: Performance benchmarks and comparative analysis
3. **Implementation Section**: Technical details and deployment guides
4. **Integration**: Combine all sections into cohesive academic paper
5. **Review**: Peer review and refinement of content

This structure provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive academic paper on Enhanced RAG-CSD systems.
